# The AHT10 is an i2c based temperature and humidity sensor.
# See data sheet:
# https://wiki.liutyi.info/download/attachments/30507639/Aosong_AHT10_en_draft_0c.pdf
#
# The VIN, GND pins are connected to the esp32 on the pins of the same name.  The i2c bus
# pins SDA and SCL pins are connected to esp32 pins 21 and 22 respectively, and configured
# below also.
# See https://esphome.io/components/sensor/aht10.html for details on the sensor.
